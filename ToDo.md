ToDo:

- Shall allow for Schema custom config
- Shall complete view
- Shall complete directives for each field type
- Shall be able to convert back to data from schemas
- Shall be able to Copy, Paste, Duplicate across namespaces
- Shall be able to Delete
- Shall be able to Add

NOTES:

- Use json as display value so we only need encode and stringify
- make schema models a var in service that can be referenced
- on a value update, redetermine the type
-
